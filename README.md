# Non-null Types and Non-null By Default (NNBD)

[Dart Enhancement Process][DEP] (DEP) proposal for ***non-null types*** and ***non-null by default***. The full proposal is available in two formats:

- [PDF](https://github.com/chalin/DEP-non-null/raw/master/doc/dep-non-null.pdf), or
- [markdown](doc/dep-non-null-AUTOGENERATED-DO-NOT-EDIT.md) (autogenerated, DO NOT EDIT).

Original markdown sources for the proposal are under [doc-src](doc-src).

-----

If you make changes and want to generate the PDF, then follow these instructions. (When submitting a Pull Request, there is no need to submit the PDF or .md under [doc](doc).)

1. To build the proposal you will need [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org), which can be installed as a [brew](http://brew.sh) [cask](http://caskroom.io) as follows:

    ```shell
    $ brew cask install pandoc
    ```

    (The `pandoc` cask takes minutes to install, against hours for the homebrew `pandoc` Formula.)

2. We also have a simple custom Pandoc filter that requires a node package so run:

    ```shell
    $ npm install
    ```

3. To generate a PDF run:

    ```shell
    $ make
    ```
